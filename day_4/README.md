# mission failed, we'll get it next time

i somewhat failed to do this day. `solution_part1.py`, which is my code for the first part, works, but the output is wrong, it should be output + 1, but im not sure how to fix it. `actual_solution_part1-2.py` is a great solution, which is not mine, and actually works. credit to [lurisoft](https://www.reddit.com/u/lurisoft?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) on reddit ([view the solution/comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zc0zta/2022_day_4_solutions/iyuviw7?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3))

what about the second part but from me? well, im kinda lazy to do that, plus all this is making me feel stressed, "forced" to do, so yeah...
